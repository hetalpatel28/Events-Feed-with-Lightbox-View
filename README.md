# Events-Feed-with-Lightbox-View
Events Feed with Lightbox View in JS.

There is no event name or type under EnglishEvents2015 entries, I filtered data, which desc has word "hispanic".

Events date,time and store name with city shows on page and by clicking on 'see more details' button,
all other details for the event can be seen on lightbox.

The pages are responsive. 
This version does not include navigation to the next event without leaving the lightbox view. 
Next event/ Prev event button can be added lightbox to see next or previous event.

Let me know your valuable feedback.
